# Chapter 2
## Obligatory Hello World Program


### Problems
- What is whitespace?

- What is a comment? What are the two ways of writing a comment?

- Our program began with package main. What would the files in the fmt package begin with?

- We used the Println function defined in the fmt package. If we wanted to use the Exit function from the os package what would we need to do?

- Modify the program we wrote so that instead of printing Hello World it prints Hello, my name is followed by your name.
